            <h3>Ligeian Project</h3>
            <p>Individual Ligeians are described as "something like a person who does something like eat people", "criminals and fugitives",  and are "cursed eternally because they devoured their children fresh from the womb". Physically they vary in their appearance, but when attacking the Exile, Echidna, KlÃªidouchos, Marinette and Sulochana are all described as "flapping nightmare[s] of teeth and webbed skin". This description is not applied to Morgen, Medusa or Rowena, due to the Exile not meeting with them in the same way as the others (or at all, in Rowena's case). However, it is likely that this description applies to all seven Ligeians and to alukites more broadly, allowing for oddities/additions like Medusa's destructive gaze.</p>
